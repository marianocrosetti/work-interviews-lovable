# Building Lovable

The task is simple: build a text to app tool like lovable. 

The app should have:
- a chat
- a preview window
- a way to work on multiple apps (“projects”)

## Requirements

### Tech stack

You are free to choose your tech stack but we would very much prefer if you can use TypeScript and/or Go since we’re already using them at lovable.


Should I focus on frontend? Backend? Infra?

It’s up to you to show us what you care about!

### Running locally

It should be easy for us to run and test your assignment. 
`npm run`, `go run`, `docker compose` are all fine. Anything that doesn't require us to setup more tools is great.


## API keys

You’ll be provided with an Anthropic API key you can use for the duration of your test work.


We’re interested in seeing:
- the code: be careful what you let AI write for you :)
- the architecture: how does the app work, how will it scale and manage more complex scenarios 
- your taste :) 


Let us know if you have any questions on the way and we'll improve instructions.
